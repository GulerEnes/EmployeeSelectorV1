Project dependencies:
	All necessary jar files are under the jar_files folder.
	While resolving you can find the jar files there. (3 files)
	After resolving or after building, the dist folder will be clean.
	If the takePhoto.exe file does not exists in the dist folder, please 
	copy the exe to under the dist folder. It should be near to the project jar file.

Project Description:
	Our project is an employee selector and job hunting program.
	It's working like a demo of a freelancer website. You can create a job advert,
	apply for a job, create a CV even with a photo. All parts of this program
	are showing in only one frame as in real-world professional programs.

Extra Features:
	1- After register, we are sending an email to say welcome.
	We use javax.mail framework to able to send an email.
	2- You can take a photo from your laptop cam if you are on Windows OS.
	We used the OpenCV framework and wrote codes in Python then, converted to exe file
	to make working on every computer, and run it with cmd codes in Java.
	3- We also use a global database. In this way wherever you run this program
	you will see the same tables, like in professional programs.
